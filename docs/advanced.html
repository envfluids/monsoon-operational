    <p>The five bars inside each 2° x 2° box correspond to the blended model's probability of onset occurring within the next 1, 2, 3, 4 weeks or later, respectively. Boxes are color‑coded to mark the two consecutive weeks with the highest combined probability (see the legend). For this purpose the "later” category is counted as a single week, and either the first week or "later” may be highlighted on their own if their individual probability exceeds 65%. For details of the forecasts, see the technical overview on the previous page.</p>
